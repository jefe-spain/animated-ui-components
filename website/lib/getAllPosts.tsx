      title: "Introducing Animated UI Components: A New Era for React Animations",
      content: `We're excited to announce that we've started working on Animated UI Components - a collection of production-ready React components powered by Rive animations! ðŸš€

Our goal is simple: make it incredibly easy to add beautiful, interactive animations to React applications without the complexity typically associated with animation development.

### What we're building:

* Drop-in React components with built-in Rive animations
* Lightweight and performant out of the box
* Full TypeScript support
* Easy customization options
* Seamless integration with existing React projects

We're currently in early development, focusing on creating a solid foundation and carefully crafting our first set of components. Stay tuned for more updates as we progress!
